# AstroMath - (Work In Progress - will be completed on aug 5)
## Destroy Asteroids By Solving Math and Save The Earth
## The Odin Project - [Jam](https://itch.io/jam/top-jam-1) - 1

## Description:
  **Asteroids** will appear on the screen with problems on their head, user will be given with 3 options to choose at any point of time in the game. The user need to choose 1 option that will solve one of the asteroids problem. If the user choose the right option, that corresponding asteroid will be destroyed. The user need to destroy all asteroids to pass the level with three stars. Yes, **1 star for 50% destruction (unlocks the next level), two for 75% and three for 100% destruction**.

## How To Play?
  **The User** needs to choose the answer that will match the problem of one of the asteroids in the screen.

## Prequel:
  **Asteroids** wanted to occupy for the earth for a long time. They are coming for us now. We need to protect the earth. The user is one of the guardians with the space ship that have super computer and attacking weapons to destroy asteroids. Every asteroid have a problem that can be solved by a super computer to three possible answers one will be correct to destroy that corresponding asteroid with a right amount of weapon. But super computer cannot accurately predict the answer because every asteroid give three possible answers while simplifying the problem but it can reduce the level of problem complexity by reducing the numbers in the problem and give that three answers by solving the asteroid problem, so user can solve it. But keep in mind, super computers predict the answers for random asteroids that is in front of the ship.
